topography
=============================================
Solution to the following problem:
You are given a 2 dimensional array of integers
as input. The array represents a rectangular 
topographic map. Each entry in the array represents
the height of the corresponding tile.
The problem is to devise an
algorithm to determine how much water the map
will hold. Water will spill off from all the edges
and, transitively, from any tile next to an
edge that is the same height or higher.
